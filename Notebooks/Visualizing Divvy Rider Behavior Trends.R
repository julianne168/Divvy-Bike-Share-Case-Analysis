# Customer (Casual Users):
# Weekend Peak: Saturday and Sunday are the busiest days, with 317,848 and 266,194 rides respectively.
# Insight: Casual users prefer riding on weekends, likely for leisure, tourism, or social activities.
# Friday also sees high ridership, possibly due to people starting weekends early or transitioning into weekend activities.
#  ðŸ“Œ Conclusion: Customers are "leisure-oriented" riders, with usage peaks on weekends and Fridays.

# ---- Member (Subscribers):
# Weekday Peak: Wednesday, Tuesday, and Thursday are the most active days.
# Insight: Members likely use bikes primarily for commuting, showing stable weekday patterns.
# ðŸ“Œ Conclusion: Members are "commute-oriented" riders, peaking midweek (Tuesdayâ€“Thursday).
#  Strategic Insight: Targeted promotions (e.g., weekend passes for Customers, weekday discounts for Members) could optimize ridership and revenue.
